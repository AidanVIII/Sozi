Two install locations are possible:

   * either the extension folder of Inkscape for all users (e.g. /usr/share/inkscape/extensions/)
   * or your personal Inkscape extension folder (~/.config/inkscape/extensions)

Close all running instances of Inkscape and copy the following files to the location you have chosen:

   sozi.inx
   sozi.py
   sozi.js
