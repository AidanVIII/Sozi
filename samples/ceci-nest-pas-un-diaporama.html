      <h1>Sozi presentation in an iframe</h1>

      <p>
         Sozi is a small program that can play animated presentations.
      </p>

         </iframe>
      </center>

      <p>
         Unlike in most presentation applications, a Sozi document is not organised as a slideshow,
         but rather as a poster where the content of your presentation can be freely laid out.
         Playing such a presentation consists in a series of translations, zooms and rotations that
         allow to focus on the elements you want to show.
      </p>

         Sozi is based on open standards. 
         It is free software distributed according to the terms of the GPL 3.0.
