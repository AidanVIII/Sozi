      <h1>Sozi presentation in an iframe</h1>

      <p>
         Sozi is a program that can play animated presentations.
      </p>

      <center>
         <iframe width="500px" height="350px" src="this-is-not-a-slideshow.fast.svg">
         </iframe>
      </center>

      <p>
         Unlike in most presentation applications, a Sozi document is not organised as a slideshow,
         but rather as a poster where the content of your presentation can be freely laid out.
         Playing such a presentation consists in a series of translations, zooms and rotations that
         allow to focus on the elements you want to show.
